\description{
Cicero coaccessibility analysis for peaks that overlap SNPs derived
from analysis of scATAC-seq data.
Each row represents an individual peak identified from the feature
binarization analysis (see methods).
}
\details{
Data originally from \href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-020-00721-x}{
Corces et al. (bioRxiv)}, as of May 2020.
Specifically: \emph{STable10_Coacessibility_Peak_loop_connection},
\emph{Cicero Coaccessibility} sheet.
Peak_ID_Peak1 - A unique number that identifies the peak across
supplementary tables.
